Two data found not significantly different. Here are the key differences. 
-	The mean of the June is 3 point higher than the December one. Which summer is not accounted as too much hotter than the winter. 
-	However, the minimum temperature shows almost 9 points lower in December, which mean it can mean temperature goes lower at nights of winter. 
-	25% of temperature also shows some difference as in June its 73, thus in December its 69.


# Summary

As W.Avy wants to open a surf/Ice-cream shop in Oahu. The temperature plays a big role to determine the eligibilty the furture of the buisness. The analyis takes place in June and December which is to determine the year-round temperature trend. As, two months show not much of difference, we can know that the buisness could be sustainable year-round, but in winter, it could be less bust since it might be colder at nights. As an analyist I would recommand a addtional goods to sell to make-up the loss of ice-cream sales in the winter.
